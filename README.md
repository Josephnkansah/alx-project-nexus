## 🌐 Overview of the ProDev Engineering Program

The **ALX ProDev Engineering Program** is an advanced learning experience focused on real-world software development. It is split into **Frontend** and **Backend Engineering** tracks to build strong, job-ready engineers.

This repository documents the **Frontend track** learnings and collaborations with Backend learners for full-stack projects.

## 🧗 Challenges Faced & Solutions

| Challenge | Solution |
|----------|----------|
| Navigating between multiple files/screens in React Native | Implemented stack navigation and used `expo-router` to simplify routing |
| Reusability of styles | Organized global styles using separate `styles/` files and Tailwind utility classes |
| Slow debugging process with native devices | Used Expo Go with live reloading and proper console logging |
| Time management during sprints | Broke tasks into smaller subtasks and used Trello/Notion for tracking |

---

## ✅ Best Practices & Takeaways

- Keep components small and reusable
- Use type safety with TypeScript
- Organize styles for consistency
- Separate concerns: constants, components, assets
- Maintain clean Git commit history
- Ask for help early and collaborate with backend learners

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

This project was made better through continuous collaboration:

- With **Frontend peers**: sharing tips, reviewing components, and solving issues together
- With **Backend learners**: integrating endpoints, understanding API contracts, and full-stack synergy

Join the discussion on **Discord: `#ProDevProjectNexus`** to collaborate, ask questions, and grow!
